      description:
        "For over eight years, residents of Oyediran village in Osun State have been without access to healthcare, as their once-operational primary health centre has been abandoned. <br> <br> As reported by Noah Aderoju, this has left villagers, especially pregnant women, facing dangerous, long-distance journeys on poor roads to reach medical services in nearby towns. The situation worsens during the rainy season, with residents trapped by flooding, further highlighting the critical need for a functional health facility.<br><br> <a href='https://checkmyphc.org/blog/phc-in-oyediran-village-aground-for-over-8-years-as-residents-bemoan'>Source: Orodata Science Report</a>",

        "Each ward is expected to have a primary health care centre (PHC) in accordance with the standards set by the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA). However, a major challenge facing Oyediran and its neighbouring communities is inadequate staffing at their PHC. <br><br> According to NPHCDA guidelines, a functional PHC should have a minimum staffing level that includes doctors, nurses, midwives, community health extension workers (CHEWs), and support staff to adequately serve the communityâ€™s needs. In Oyediran, the absence of essential health workers has left residents struggling to access basic healthcare services",
